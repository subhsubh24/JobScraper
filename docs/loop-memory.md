# LOOP MEMORY — Career Operator (cross-run lessons)

Durable lessons for the factory loop. Append dated entries. Keep it honest and short.

### 2026-06-27 — Bootstrap lesson
- **The repo wins over assumptions.** The bootstrap charter assumed "Python SaaS, NO
  mobile app." Reality: a **Flutter** prototype existed in `/mobile`. Owner chose to
  re-platform to **Expo/React Native + TypeScript** (matches the apparatus: preflight
  `tsc`, mobile CI). Flutter was moved to `/mobile-flutter-legacy` for reference, not
  deleted blindly. **Always orient against the real tree before building.**
- **BUILDS ≠ WORKS is not theoretical here.** `import api` exits 0, but `api.py` calls
  `AuthService.create_user/generate_token/authenticate_user`, `JobScorer().score_job(job=dict)`,
  `workflows.workflow_company_dossier`, `coach.chat(db=...)` — **none exist with those
  signatures** in `src/`. Only `/health` is functionally real. Import-success and
  HTTP-200 prove nothing; assert the user-visible outcome.
- **Graceful degradation is a release gate, not a nicety.** Scoring/prep/coach hard-fail
  with no `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The core journey must work (heuristic fallback) in a seeded
  env with no paid key, so the journey suite can run anywhere.
- **No CI exists and the loop may not add it** (`.github/` is off-limits). The gate is
  `scripts/preflight.sh` run locally + the two-gate readiness audit. CI wiring is an
  owner action (workflow scope) in PENDING_OPS.
- **Honest baseline beats a green-looking fake.** DoD starts all `[ ]`; business case is
  honestly below the $100K floor (`floor_met_year1: false`); growth is `pre_launch`,
  engine 0%. Convergence happens over scheduled runs, not by ticking boxes early.
